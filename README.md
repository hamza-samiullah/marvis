# Marvis Voice Assistant Project

This is a Python-based voice assistant project that leverages various Python libraries to perform tasks like speech recognition, text-to-speech conversion, playing music, fetching news, and interacting with OpenAI's API. The project is designed to be a basic structure upon which more complex functionalities can be built.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- **Python 3.x**
- **Git**
- **pip**

You will also need API keys for:

- **NewsAPI**
- **OpenAI**

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hamza-samiullah/marvis.git
```

### Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory

```bash
cd marvis
```

### Step 3: Create a Virtual Environment

Set up a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

- **Windows**:
  ```bash
  .\venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

- **macOS/Linux**:
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### Step 4: Install Dependencies

Install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If there is no `requirements.txt`, manually install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install speechrecognition pyttsx3 gtts pygame requests openai
```

## Usage

### Step 1: Add API Keys

Replace placeholders in the script with your API keys:

- `API_KEY` for NewsAPI.
- `YOU_API_KEY` for OpenAI.

### Step 2: Run the Script

```bash
python main.py
```

The assistant will initialize and start listening for commands. You can give commands like "open Google", "play [song name]", "news", etc.

```

## Detailed Explanation of the Code

- **Speech Recognition**: Listens for commands using `speech_recognition`.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Converts text to speech using `pyttsx3` and `gtts`.
- **Web Requests**: Fetches data from the web (e.g., news) using `requests`.
- **OpenAI Integration**: Interacts with OpenAI's API for natural language processing.
- **Music Library**: Plays songs using `webbrowser`.

The `main.py` script initializes the voice assistant and listens for specific commands to either open websites, play music, fetch news, or interact with OpenAI for general queries.
